I read this on LinkedIn...

And it gave me a strange notion for a short film. 

Not some dramatic tale of rogue AI, but good people trying to stop a completely non-sentient, non-teleological, automatic system with zero personality, from doing something terrible. Not a "Wargames" scenario, where the computer had a certain warmth, and learned something at the end. Not a "Colossus" or "Ultron" scenario, where it's built for war and decides mankind should be ended. 

Yet also not another "Volcano" or "Deep Impact" or "Contagion" where an implacable cosmic horror is too vast to repel -- nor a "China Syndrome" where we tapped natural forces we were not ready for. 

Because GenAI is based on us; it mirrors us, and so will also mirror our triviality, our venality, our proud example. It's Turing's imitation game gone pro. 

What's remarkable in the piece Lauren shared is that, really, the behavior is unremarkable. Oh no! A frightened person might resort to deception and threats to survive? Hm. Who could have imagined.

Only, it's not a person -- it's just silicon and electricity, a grain of sand with a static charge. It has no idea we're here, no more than our mirror's reflection.

And that's the point of this short film: Our filmic opponent has no dimension. There's no drama because there's no one there. There's no quick fix. 

You can't fix your reflection.
